# Online Music Hackathon 2019
**Theme**: MUSIC!

**Rules:** As always, must be original content &amp; MUST be created and hosted on Repl.it
**Dates:** July 1 @ 00:00 PST to July 21 @ 00:00 PST

## Business Plan

**Suggestion :** Create an application in Python 3.

**Subject :**  The application will be a music player with Artificial Intelligence playlists.

More specifically the user will Login in the platform using his/her user name. Secondly he/she will be able to search for an artist, to listen to his/her favorite music or songs.

**Al :** Every time the user is looking for an artist, the name of the artist will be automatically saved in a list. So every time the user logs in he/she will be provided with sample playlists according to the artist and more specifically according to the relevant percentage of the artists.

**For example :** The user has made in total 6 searches : 3 for Ariana Grande , 2 for Selena Gomez , 1 for Katy Perry. That means that the list must contain 3/6 (50%) Ariana Grande songs, 2/6 (33%) Selena Gomez songs and 1/6 (17%) Katy Perry songs.

**Needed files:**

 - main.py
 
Graphic creation

- intro.py

Create Artificial Intelligence (AI) which will save all searches in a txt file and will export the personalized playlists.

 - user.py

Create the profile only if it’s a new one.

 - users 
	 - someone.txt 
	 - someone_else.txt 
	 - someone_else_No2.txt
